# js-random-generator

You will create an interactive page that generates some kind of "random" content directed at your visitorâ€“ they can be random "fortunes", outfits to wear, meals to eat, activities to try... anything at all!

- Write a function called `fortune` that will take one argument (your visitor's name) and prints a random "fortune teller style" fortune into an element of your page.

- Write a function called `restyle` that applies new CSS styles to the `fortune` text in a random manner each time it fires. Modify at least three CSS properties.

You will also be creating a calculator

- Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result in an `alert`. It should also log a string to the console like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
